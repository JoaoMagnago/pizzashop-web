# Pizza Shop

A study project with **Vite**, **React**, **Typescript**, **shadcn/ui** and **Radix UI** with the goal of practicing back-end and front-end communication using React Query.

An application where a pizza place can visualize the financial history of previous weeks in sales through a dashboard filled with graphs and filters. It is also possible to manually change active orders statuses.

Some important libraries used are:
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (for usage of premade components)
* [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) (also used in the design system)
